	<p>
		We will create a web-based graphical interface for users to interact
		with the pipeline. Like the original solution, users can choose 
		images through <a href="https://pilot.wr.usgs.gov">Pilot</a>, which 
		will then be processed through the pipeline. To make the user interface,
		we will use N8N and create nodes for ISIS3 commands. Users will be able 
		to drag and drop these blocks into the diagram in any order. The user 
		will be able to see the current progress of the pipeline, and output the 
		files to a chosen location. We will have intermediate storage between 
		each step, which will allow us to use the output of one function as the 
		input to another.
