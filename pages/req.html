        <li>
            <b>Integration of a pipeline framework</b>: In order to allow users
            to quickly and easily create image processing pipelines, we want
            to integrate a UI framework for building directed, acyclic graphs.
            We've chosen <a target="_blank" href="https://n8n.io">n8n</a>
            to integrate into our project for this purpose.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>User Input and Output</b>: Users need to specify one or more
            input images. Images will come from
            <a target="_blank" href="https://pilot.wr.usgs.gov">Pilot</a>, the
            Astrogeology Science Center's library of planetary images. Users
            also need to be able to specify where output images will be stored
            after processing. Output options could include receiving the images
            via email or a USGS-only storage area.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>ISIS Processing Server</b>: Images from satellites can be much
            larger than the average image file, and commands from the ISIS
            suite can take up a lot of processing power. For this reason, Team
            Osiris needs to develop a dedicated backend server that will run
            ISIS commands based on incoming requests from our frontend. The
            server will run the ISIS command requested by the n8n node and
            return the result back to that n8n node.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Image Storage</b>: Both the inputs and outputs of the ASC
            Processing Pipeline are larger-than-normal image files. To deal
            with this, we need dedicated storage. Team Osiris will integrate
            Amazon's S3 into the application, decoupling storage from both the
            UI and processing server. The UI will push pipeline input to the S3
            server, where the processing server will pull it down. After a
            processing command is complete, the processing server will push its
            output back to S3, where the UI can pick it up again.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Security</b>: Since the ASC Processing Pipeline is essentially
            a remote command execution server, we need to make sure that only
            ISIS commands are run, and that only image files are provided as
            input. This type of validation will be done both in the UI and
            on the backend.
