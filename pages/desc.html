    <p>
        The exploration of space beyond our own planet has fascinated
        geologists, physicists, engineers, and the general public for decades.
    </p>
    <p>
        It takes more than the efforts of astronauts to explore space. At the
        U.S. Geological Surveyâ€™s Astrogeology Science Center in Flagstaff,
        Arizona, scientists explore the surfaces of other planets via images
        from satellites and space probes.
    </p>
    <p>
        The most vital piece of software used in the analysis and transformation
        of planetary image data is the Integrated Software for Imagers and
        Spectrometers suite, or
        <a href="https://isis.astrogeology.usgs.gov" target="_blank">ISIS</a>.
        However, ISIS is a set of command-line
        tools with no support for cloud processing.
    </p>
    <p>
        Team Osiris will develop a platform for creating directed, acyclic
        graphs of ISIS image processing commands. Users will be able to browse
        to a web application, select one or more input images, and choose
        processing nodes from a catalog of ISIS commands. Users will then
        be able to configure their commands and link them together in any order.
    </p>
    <p>
        This web-based image processing pipeline will lower the barrier for
        entry to the ISIS suite, making the manipulation of satellite images
        as easy as a couple of clicks.
