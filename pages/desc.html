    <p>
        The exploration of space beyond our own planet has fascinated
        geologists, physicists, engineers, and the general public for decades.
    </p>
    <p>
        It takes more than the efforts of astronauts to explore space. At the
        U.S. Geological Surveyâ€™s Astrogeology Science Center (ASC) in Flagstaff,
        Arizona, scientists explore the surfaces of other planets via images
        from satellites and space probes.
    </p>
    <p>
        The most vital piece of software used in the analysis and transformation
        of planetary image data is the Integrated Software for Imagers and
        Spectrometers suite, or ISIS. However, ISIS is a set of command-line
        tools with no support for cloud processing.
    </p>
    <p>
        Team Osiris will develop a directed, acyclic graph of ISIS image
        processing commands. Users will be able to browse to a web application,
        select one or more input images, choose processing nodes from a
        catalog of ISIS commands, configure and customize those processing
        nodes, then link them together in any order.
